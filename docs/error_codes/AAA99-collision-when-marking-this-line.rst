AAA99: collision when marking this line as NEW_CODE, was already OLD_CODE
=========================================================================

This is an error code that is raised when Flake8 tries to mark a single line as
occupied by two different types of block. It *should* never happen. The values
for ``NEW_CODE`` and ``OLD_CODE`` are as follows:

ACT
    Line is part of the Act Block.

ARR
    Line is part of an Arrange Block.

ASS
    Line is part of the Assert Block.

BL
    Line is considered a blank line for layout purposes.

CMT
    Line is a ``#`` comment.

DEF
    Test function definition.

???
    Unprocessed line. Flake8-AAA has not categorised this line.

Resolution
----------

Please open a `new issue
<https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/new>`_ containing the output
for the failing test as generated by ``flake8``.

You could hack around with your test to see if you can get it to work while
waiting for someone to reply to your issue. If you're able to adjust the test
to get it to work, that updated test would also be helpful for debugging.
