Compatibility list
==================

Flake8-AAA is compatible with the following software. Future versions will
maintain this compatibility as closely as possible.

Python
------

Works with Python 3.

Flake8-AAA is fully compatible and tested against the latest versions of Python
3. Currently that's 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10.

.. admonition:: See also...

    :ref:`Previously supported Python versions <previous-python-versions>`.

Flake8
------

Works with Flake8 version 3 and later.

We use the newer plugin system implemented in Flake8 v3. This dependency is not
specified in ``setup.py`` because users may only want to use the command line
interface.

Check that Flake8-AAA was installed correctly by asking ``flake8`` for its
version signature:

.. code-block:: shell

    flake8 --version

.. code-block::

    4.0.1 (aaa: 0.12.2, mccabe: 0.6.1, pycodestyle: 2.8.0, pyflakes: 2.4.0) CPython 3.10.1 on Linux

The ``aaa: 0.12.2`` part of that output tells you Flake8 found this plugin.

Yapf
----

Yapf is used to format Flake8-AAA code and tests. It is the primary formatter
focused on for compatibility.

Black
-----

Flake8-AAA is compatible with tests formatted with Black.

    The coding style used by Black can be viewed as a strict subset of PEP8.

The AAA pattern is PEP8 compatible so it makes sense that Flake8-AAA should
work with PEP8 compatible formatters.

This compatibility is pinned by the test examples in the `examples/good/black
directory
<https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/tree/master/examples/good/black>`_.
These tests are formatted with the latest version of Black in default mode.
They are then checked to pass Flake8-AAA's linting.

.. note::

    We are aware that new management of blank lines released in Black
    ``23.1.0`` cause ``AAA03`` errors to be raised and this is tracked `in
    issue #200 <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/200>`_.

Pytest
------

Pytest is fully supported.

To pin this compatibility we use the latest version of Pytest in the
Flake8-AAA test suite and lint that test suite with Flake8-AAA (aka. dog
fooding).

Unittest
--------

Python unittest style is supported.

To pin this compatibility we include unittest-style tests in the `examples/good
directory
<https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/tree/master/examples/good>`_.
