Compatibility list
==================

Flake8-AAA is compatible with the following software. Future versions will
maintain this compatibility as closely as possible.

Python
------

Works with Python 3.

Flake8-AAA is fully compatible and tested against the active versions of Python
3 as listed on the `python.org downloads page
<https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.

.. admonition:: See also...

    See :ref:`full list of previously supported Python versions
    <previous-python-versions>` for links to the last supported packages and
    documentation.

Flake8
------

Works with Flake8 version 3 and later. All integration tests run with the
latest version of Flake8 they can find for the active version of Python.

We use the newer plugin system implemented in Flake8 v3. This dependency is not
specified in ``setup.py`` because users may only want to use the command line
interface.

Check that Flake8-AAA was installed correctly by asking ``flake8`` for its
version signature:

.. code-block:: shell

    flake8 --version

.. code-block::

    6.0.0 (flake8-aaa: 0.15.0, mccabe: 0.7.0, pycodestyle: 2.10.0, pyflakes: 3.0.1) CPython 3.11.0 on Linux

The ``flake8-aaa: 0.14.1`` part of that output tells you Flake8 found this
plugin.

Yapf
----

`Yapf <https://github.com/google/yapf>`_ is used to format Flake8-AAA code and
tests. It is the primary formatter focused on for compatibility.

Black
-----

Flake8-AAA is compatible with tests formatted with `Black
<https://github.com/psf/black>`_.

Black version ``23.1.0`` changed how it managed blank lines by default. Set
:ref:`"large" Act block style option or configuration <large-act-block-style>`
when running via Flake8 for best compatibility with Black:

.. code-block:: shell

    flake8 --aaa-act-block-style=large

See also `Black formatted example tests
<https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/tree/master/examples/#black-formatted-examples>`_
in Flake8-AAA's test suite.

Pytest
------

Pytest is fully supported.

To pin this compatibility we use the latest version of Pytest in the
Flake8-AAA test suite and lint that test suite with Flake8-AAA (aka. dog
fooding).

Unittest
--------

Python unittest style is supported.

To pin this compatibility we include unittest-style tests in the `examples/good
directory
<https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/tree/master/examples/good>`_.
