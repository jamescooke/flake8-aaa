# Environments
# ------------
#
# * cmd
#       Run the command line interface (`python -m flake8_aaa`) on all good
#       example files. Expect no errors and no non-zero error codes.
# * cmdbad
#       Run all bad examples through command line interface and ensure an error
#       code is returned for every one.
# * doc
#       Emulate the documentation build on RTD.
# * examples
#       Check all examples, good and bad. Includes linting with vanilla Flake8
#       and assert tests formatted with Black pass. All (working) examples
#       executed with vanilla pytest.
# * examples_aaa
#       Ensures that all examples work against Flake8-AAA as expected. Good
#       examples are green. Bad examples are linted and the output asserted to
#       match expected.
# * install
#       Assert that plugin can be installed and run via flake8 in a clean venv.
#       Flake8 is called with flake8-aaa installed to lint flake8-aaa's tests
#       (dog fooding) Test requirements do not include flake8-aaa, latest
#       version is installed by tox during testing.
# * lint
#       "Internal" linting and formatting on the codebase and tests. Not run
#       with Flake8-aaa installed (that happens in "install" env). Does not
#       check examples (that happens in "examples" and "examples_aaa" envs).
# * test
#       Run pytest on test suite.
