  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/185>`_.

Changed
.......

  strings. Also reduce use of ``vx.y.z`` version strings - use just ``x.y.z``
  instead. `Pull #207 <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/pull/207>`_.

0.13.1_ - 2023/02/27

0.13.0_ - 2023/02/17
--------------------

Added
.....

  ``import pytest`` and not ``from pytest import raises``. `Pull #199
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/pull/199>`_.

Changed
.......

* ‚õèÔ∏è CI system (GitHub Actions) adjusted to install pinned requirements from

--------------------

Removed
.......

* Support for Python 3.6 `#189
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/pull/189>`_

0.12.1_ - 2022/01/01
--------------------

Added
.....

* Support for Python 3.10 `#187
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/pull/187>`_

0.12.0_ - 2021/05/01
--------------------

Fixed
.....

* Fix marking of act blocks on multiple lines - allow ``# act`` markers to be
  found on the last line of possible multi line act blocks. `#165
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/165>`_

0.11.2_ - 2021/04/22
--------------------

Added
.....

* Support for Python 3.9 `#177
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/pull/177>`_

Changed
.......

* CI system changed from Travis to GitHub actions. `#173
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/173>`_. 

* Adjusted "examples_aaa" tox environments to sort both outputs and expected
  outputs because there were inconsistencies in sorting between local dev and
  CI.

0.11.1_ - 2020/12/28
--------------------

Fixed
.....

* Bug which prevented act block hints containing capital letters (like ``#
  Act``) from being found `#167
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/167>`_

0.11.0_ - 2020/07/26
--------------------

Changed
.......

* Adjust rules for comments: no comments allowed in Act blocks. `#148
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/148>`_. 

0.10.1_ - 2020/06/20
--------------------

Added
.....

* Add good example usage of the assignment expression in Python 3.8 to
  guarantee compatibility. `#120
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/120>`_.

* Tokens now received from Flake8 to help with comment analysis. `#148
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/148>`_.

Changed
.......

* Stringy line analysis adjusted to use Constant visitor since Str visitor is
  deprecated as of Python 3.8. `#145
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/145>`_.

* Blank line analysis now carried out using tokens rather than tokenised AST.
  `#157 <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/pull/157>`_.

0.10.0_ - 2020/05/24
--------------------

Added
.....

* Test examples are intended to be real but simple examples. All examples added
  or updated from now on must:

  - Go green when run with Pytest.

  - Use only standard library imports.

Changed
.......

* README rewritten and expanded to be more friendly to readers that are not
  aware of the AAA pattern. Template from `The Documentation Compendium
  <https://github.com/kylelobo/The-Documentation-Compendium>`_.  `#141
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/141>`_.

* Behaviour of context managers in tests has been changed. Going forwards only
  with statements that are used to catch exceptions are considered actions, for
  example, ``with pytest.raises(...):``. Otherwise, the with statement is
  arrangement or assertion and must be separated from the Act block by a blank
  line as usual. `#146 <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/146>`_.

  Implementing this feature meant changing the line-by-line analysis that
  happens on test function bodies.

0.9.0_ - 2020/03/07
-------------------

Changed
.......

* Simply named files are now checked. For example ``test.py`` and ``tests.py``
  are now checked but were skipped before. `#124
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/124>`_.

Removed
.......

* Doctesting of internal helpers functions - not worth managing a whole tox
  environment for when only two functions are being tested, and it's easier to
  write the cases in pytest anyway. Tests moved to pytest.

0.8.1_ - 2020/03/01
-------------------

Changed
.......

* Line that are covered by strings (like docstrings) are found with a
  ``NodeVisitor``. Previously this was an iterator on the tree. `#132
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/pull/132>`_.

0.8.0_ - 2020/02/27
-------------------

Changed
.......

* Install requires ASTTokens version 2 or greater, was previously
  ``>= 1.1.10``.

* Special test examples that only ran on Python 3.6 and greater, now merged
  into main test suite. `#128
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/pull/128>`_

Removed
.......

* Support for Python 3.5. `#110
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/110>`_

* Pylint removed from linting checks.

0.7.2_ - 2020/02/24
-------------------

Fixed
.....

* Bug preventing type annotated assignment Act blocks from being found `#123
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/pull/123>`_

0.7.1_ - 2019/11/16
-------------------

Added
.....

* Expanded test suite to run Python 3.8 and added Python 3.8 meta tags. `#119
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/pull/119>`_

Fixed
.....

* Bug occurring when running Python 3.8 and linting test functions that are
  decorated has been fixed. `#119
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/pull/119>`_

0.7.0_ - 2019/07/14
-------------------

Added
.....

* Improved documentation on use of ``# noqa`` comments. `#102
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/102>`_.

Changed
.......

* AAA03 and AAA04 (checks for a single blank line before and after Act block)
  line numbers have been moved down. `Part of #79
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/79#issuecomment-495814091>`_.

* AAA03 and AAA04 errors now return a real offset. `#79
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/79>`_.

0.6.2_ - 2019/06/29
-------------------

Added
.....

* Add tests for compatibility with Black to the test suite. `#90
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/90>`_

* New compatibility list shows what Flake8-AAA works with now and plans to
  support in the future. `#97
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/97>`_

Fixed
.....

* F-string processing was crashing Flake8-AAA with all versions of Python. This
  has been fixed with a workaround. `#101
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/101>`_

  This will be "fully fixed" in the first minor version after support for
  Python 3.5 is dropped. `#110
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/110>`_

0.6.1_ - 2019/05/26
-------------------

Added
.....

* Output the total number of errors found in a file from the command line
  interface, along with a big "PASSED!" or "FAILED"

* New test run ``cmdbad`` asserts that all bad example files return at least
  one error and a non-zero error code when run through the command line.

Fixed
.....

* Command line was not returning total number of errors in the file. Instead it
  was returning the number of errors in the last function. This meant that
  false positives were given for files that contained errors, but where the
  last test in the file contained none - in this case a ``0`` return value was
  given. `#90 <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/90>`_


0.6.0_ - 2019/04/28
-------------------

Added
.....

* New rule ``AAA05`` "blank line in block". `#66
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/66>`_.

Changed
.......

* Adjusted error handling so that multiple errors can be returned. `#76
  <https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/issues/76>`_.

* Blank line analysis changed drastically. Now runs first as part of the test
  function analysis and finds all blank lines that are not part of a string
  literal.

0.5.2_ - 2019/02/27
-------------------

Added
.....

* Support for Python 3.7.

Changed
.......

* Act node now distinguished from Act block in code and docs. Generic ``Block``
  class now handles all blocks.

* Python warnings now reported in test runs.

* Command line wrapper fixed to manually close files opened by ``argparse``.

0.5.1_ - 2019/02/01
-------------------

Added
.....

* Bad examples folder. This is used for testing that files containing tests
  that fail linting return the expected content when run with ``flake8```.

Fixed
.....

* Spacing between Arrange and Act analysis fixed. Now recognises comment
  blocks.

* Spacing between Act and Assert analysis fixed. Now recognises comment blocks.

* Act Blocks can now contain context managers that are not test suite exception
  catchers like ``pytest.raises()``.

Changed
.......

* Location of package pushed down to ``/src`` directory as `recommended by
  pytest
  <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/goodpractices.html#choosing-a-test-layout-import-rules>`_.

0.5.0_ - 2018/11/01
-------------------

Added
.....

* Python 3.5 now supported.

* Command line functionality now available to assist with development and
  debugging.

* New line-wise analysis, including updated blank line checking and a new
  ``AAA99`` rule for node to line mapping collisions.

Removed
.......

* Python 2.7 support removed.

* ``flake8`` package removed as a dependency since Flake8-AAA can be run on a
  command line without it.

0.4.0_ - 2018/07/17
-------------------

Added
.....

* Support for unittest tests.

Changed
.......

* Improved loading of Act blocks so that they can be found within context
  managers.

0.3.0_ - 2018/06/28
-------------------

Added
.....

* New rule ``AAA03`` "expected 1 blank line before Act block, found none"

* New rule ``AAA04`` "expected 1 blank line before Assert block, found none"

0.2.0_ - 2018/05/28
-------------------

Added
.....

* `Documentation on RTD <https://flake8-aaa.readthedocs.io/>`_

Fixed
.....

* Allow parsing of files containing unicode.

* Do not parse ``pytest.raises`` blocks in Assert block as Actions.
